# D2.4: Analyses of simulations for Deliverable D2.4
The code for the analyses in this work as well as the plots are presented in jupyter notebooks

## Making sure everything works fine
You'll need to install some python dependencies, if you use pip you can direclty run
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you should be able to run:
```shell
jupyter-notebook
```

This will open your web browser and display the jupyter notebooks of the project


## notebook_v1.ipynb
It contains the results for the first simulation with personas for IDF on a 1% scale.
You will need both the simulation inputs and outputs to perform the analysis.

The paths in the notebook are relative. The inputs and outputs for the simulations should be placed in the same path as the notebook. Links can be used to avoid hard copies of the files. 
Just change the values `inputs.lnk` and `outputs.lnk` to the folder/link names in your system.
